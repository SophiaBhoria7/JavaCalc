# Java Calc

This program includes the code that I built through using a heavy use of the Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Swing file that is incorporated in the system. This is a simple calculator, however, the programming allows a solid foundation of all the skills from GUI to Swing to Events that were used in this program.
